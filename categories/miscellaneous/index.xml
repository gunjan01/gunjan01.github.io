      <description>Lesser waste August  I am not really a hard core environmentalist but definitely someone who wants to try. It is said, &amp;ldquo;Motivation gets you started, habits keep you going solid&amp;rdquo;. Lately, the two beautiful bloggers and Youtubers, Lauren Singer from Trash is for Tossers  and Sadia Badiei from Pick up Limes  have inspired me to bring about some good reforms in my current lifestyle.

Ordered sub-list And another item.  ⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we&amp;rsquo;ll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).
⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.</description>
