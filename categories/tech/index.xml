      <description>Disclaimer: Off late, I have been trying to say this out loud in the most appropriate manner, but trying to find a way which is not offensive to anybody has been futile. So, I have decided to write about it with utmost honesty. This post is solely about my experience in tech communities and may not be in line with yours. So if you are reading this blog, please read with a light heart and think of it as an alternate perspective from a person in early stages of career and communities who might need enlightenment (and trust me, I am all ears for it).</description>

      <description>I am kind of inspired by a beautiful blog I read in the morning about tech and that reminds me it’s almost been a year ( two months to go) until I finish my first year in the IT industry. (phew :P ) So ergoes, a jot of things I quickly learnt and few I learned the hard way. These opinions are my own and you don’t have to agree.</description>
