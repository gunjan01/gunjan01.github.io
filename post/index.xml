      <description>This post is about my first high altitude trek in the Himalayas. I chose to do the Buran Ghati trek as it felt high on adventure and was a complete package, from meadows, to boulders, to snowfall you can get to see it all. The pass lies in the snow capped mountains of the Dhauladhar range and Gunas Pass falling in the Lesser Himalayas or the Mahabharata range.
 I actually came to the mountains to think about what to do next and they gave me so much more.</description>

      <description>The marathon. How an average runner becomes more than average.
 I don’t really remember when I started caring about fitness but it was vaguely at the start of this year, I think. I have ( was would be more appropriate, perhaps :P) been over confident when it came to gaining weight. “Oh! I never really gain weight” was something common you would hear from me whilst gobbling calories consciously others might give a second thought to.</description>

      <description>I am kind of inspired by a beautiful blog I read in the morning about tech and that reminds me it’s almost been a year ( two months to go) until I finish my first year in the IT industry. (phew :P ) So ergoes, a jot of things I quickly learnt and few I learned the hard way. These opinions are my own and you don’t have to agree.</description>

      <description>Some junk from the Internet  First ordered list item Another item ⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. Actual numbers don&amp;rsquo;t matter, just that it&amp;rsquo;s a number ⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list And another item.  ⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we&amp;rsquo;ll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).
⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.</description>
