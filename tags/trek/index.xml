      <description>This post is about my first high altitude trek in the Himalayas. I chose to do the Buran Ghati trek as it felt high on adventure and was a complete package, from meadows, to boulders, to snowfall you can get to see it all. The pass lies in the snow capped mountains of the Dhauladhar range and Gunas Pass falling in the Lesser Himalayas or the Mahabharata range.
 I actually came to the mountains to think about what to do next and they gave me so much more.</description>
